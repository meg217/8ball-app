# Try it live!
https://meg217.github.io/8ball-app/
- Our backend is hosted locally, but the live version still shows the functionality without the backend api requests


# How we built it
The project itself was build by Kevin De Hoyos, and I. We used Flask, SQLite, Python, Javascript, Axios, React, HTML, CSS, and built it in VSCode. In the end, we deployed it to GitHub pages, and plan to deploy the backend flask+database in the future.

# Project Story
The main story of our project is that it starts off with a introduction back story of a land before rowdy hacks. A meteor hits earth, not just a normal meteor but a magic 8 ball. It leads to a dinosaur picking it up and you can now ask questions or have a question randomly generated.

# Challenges we ran into
Some of the challenges we ran into was getting all of our html and css elements to do what we wanted them to. In the end we were able to get it done right, we currently have the frontend hosted and will finish getting the backend hosted.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
This is both of our first RowdyHacks. With that being said, we are proud that we stayed determined and finished strong. We learned a lot since we went in never using React before, and successfully build a react driven application. As well, we have never before built a project with both the backend and frontend making axios requests or having a defined interaction. We now feel confident in being able to distinguish the two.

# What we learned
-> Learned React for the first time

-> How to use axios for the first time

-> Learned to distinguish between frontend and backend

-> How to host on github pages

-> How to use SQLite for the first time

-> Learned how to integrate different medias(mp4, mp3, etc)
